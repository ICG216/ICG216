## Hi there 👋 <br>
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a **Data Analytics enthusiast** currently enrolled in a bootcamp where I'm honing my skills in extracting insights from data and translating them into actionable decisions. I’m eager to contribute to impactful projects and continue growing in this field.

## 👩‍💻 About Me <br>

I’m transitioning from the field of Videogames (3D Artist) into the field of **Data Analytics**, where I’m focused on leveraging data to solve business problems. Currently, I’m learning the tools and technologies that help organizations make data-driven decisions, including:

- **Python** for data analysis and automation.
- **SQL** for efficient data querying and manipulation.
- **Power BI** to create insightful, interactive dashboards.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data wrangling and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization.

I’m excited about applying these skills to real-world problems and collaborating on open-source projects.
