## üë©‚Äçüíª About Me <br>

I‚Äôm transitioning from the field of Videogames (3D Artist) into the field of **Data Analytics**, where I‚Äôm focused on leveraging data to solve business problems. Currently, I‚Äôm learning the tools and technologies that help organizations make data-driven decisions, including:

- **Python** for data analysis and automation.
- **SQL** for efficient data querying and manipulation.
- **Power BI** to create insightful, interactive dashboards.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data wrangling and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization.

I‚Äôm excited about applying these skills to real-world problems and collaborating on open-source projects. <br><br>
